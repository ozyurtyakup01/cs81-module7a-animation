What part of the code was most confusing and why?
I commented out the clearInterval part to see what it does everything seemed normal.There were no visible change at preview. After I added timer I realized my timer would continue even after it reach max cycle without clearInterval part

How does the animation help visualize asynchronous behavior?
Yes it does also adding feature did as I mentioned above

What did you change or improve, and what effect did it have?
I added simple timer that shows how many second passed since page started cycle
